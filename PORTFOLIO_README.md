## 🔧 Key Implementations

### **1. Dynamic Schema Management**

```python
# Dynamic schema mapping by brand
BRAND_SCHEMA = {
    "BRAND_A": "ANALYSIS_BRAND_A",
    "BRAND_B": "ANALYSIS_BRAND_B",
}

def get_table_name(brand, table_type):
    return f"DT_{brand}_{table_type}"
```

### **2. Secure Session Management**

```python
# Role-based access control
def check_permission(user_role, required_role):
    permissions = {"user": 1, "admin": 2}
    return permissions.get(user_role, 0) >= permissions.get(required_role, 0)
```

### **3. Optimized Queries**

```python
# Efficient data processing with Snowpark
@st.cache_data(ttl=300)
def get_mau_data(session, brand, schema):
    return session.table(f"{schema}.DT_{brand}_MAU_USERS").collect()
```
